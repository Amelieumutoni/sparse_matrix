**sparse Matrix Operations**

**Overview**

This project implements a sparse matrix data structure and supports operations such as addition, subtraction, and multiplication on large matrices. The matrices are stored efficiently to optimize both memory and run time.

**run the code**
python sparse.py


The result of the operation will be printed in the console, showing a summary of the resulting sparse matrix.
